With less than a month before the Belgian spring classics kick off the 2014 European professional road cycling season, I’m going to give you an overview of all one day Belgian classic races. 

Today, we start with the double shot of a Flandrian brew: Omloop Het Nieuwsblad and Kuurne - Brussels - Kuurne.

## Omloop Het Nieuwsblad

**Race day: 1 March 2014**

Omloop Het Nieuwsblad used to be known as Omloop Het Volk or simply Het Volk until 2008. It was organised by the Het Volk newspaper. In 2009, after Het Nieuwsblad took over Het Volk, the name was changed to Omloop Het Nieuwsblad to reflect the new owner.

The race is held in Oost-Vlaanderen (East Flanders) on either the last Saturday of February or the first Saturday of March. 

The first edition was raced in 1945. If you know European history, the date should stand out for you – the Second World War ended in May 1945 but the Flandrians couldn't wait for normal life to resume. 

Organising a new bike race was on a high priority list and the Omloop Het Volk was born. It's worth mentioning that during the occupation, the Nazis allowed bike racing to continue in Flanders (but not in French speaking Wallonie). For example, Ronde van Vlaanderen (Tour of Flanders) was run uninterrupted during the war. Apparently, the Germans thought that letting road racing to go on will help cultivate sympathy toward them among cycling-crazy Flandrians.

The Het Volk newspaper launched the race as a rival to Het Nieuwsblad’s Ronde van Vlaanderen. It starts and finishes in Gent. Between 1996 and 2007 the Omloop finished in Lokeren.

Because geographical locations of the Omloop and the Ronde are small and the courses interlace, both races share several climbs. 

Although Omloop Het Nieuwsblad is a full-fledged Classic, it's not a Monument like Ronde van Vlaanderen. Because of its lower status, the Omloop is used by northern classics' specialists as a test race for the Ronde. 

For example, in 2013 Jürgen Roelandts finished 8th in the Omloop and 3rd in the Ronde.

Omloop, the first race of the Belgian road cycling calendar, is associated with cold weather. Often raced in cold rain or snow (or both), the short, steep cobbled climbs make Omloop Het Nieuwsblad one of the toughest races in professional cycling.

## Kuurne - Brussels - Kuurne

**Race Day: 2 March 2014**

Kuurne - Brussels - Kuurne always follows Omloop Het Nieuwsblad the next day on Sunday. It too started in 1945. 

The race is not as brutal as the Omloop and therefore sprinters have a chance here from time to time. For example, Mark Cavendish won in 2012 and Jaan Kirsipuu in 2002. 

To this day, no rider won both the Omloop and the KBK in the same year which shows how difficult it is to be on the roll two days on the row in Flandrian spring classics.

Twelve riders won Kuurne - Brussels - Kuurne twice. Tom Boonen is the only rider still racing who can win it for the third time. His previous wins came in 2007 and 2009.

Belgians won this race 50 times out of 65 editions. 

Unlike Omloop, there is a variety of winners in KBK from different countries. Among atypical winners are Mark Cavendish from Great Britain in 2012, Australian Chris Sutton in 2011, American George Hincapie in 2005, Estonian Jaan Kirsipuu in 2002, Russian Andrei Tchmil in 1998 and 2000 (he took Belgian citizenship in 1998), Rolf Sørensen from Denmark in 1996, and Frédéric Moncassin from France in 1995. 

The Dutch had a good run too: 8 wins in 68 years with Steven de Jongh the most successful among them with 2 wins in 2004 and 2008.
